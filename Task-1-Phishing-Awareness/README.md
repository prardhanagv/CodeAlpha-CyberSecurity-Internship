🛡️ Task 1: Phishing Awareness Campaign

Educating users to recognize, prevent, and respond to phishing attacks.

🎯 Objective

To create awareness about phishing attacks by explaining how they work, how to identify them, and how to stay protected from falling victim.

📌 Introduction

Phishing is a social engineering attack where cybercriminals impersonate trusted organizations to steal sensitive information such as:
