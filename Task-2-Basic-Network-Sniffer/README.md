# CodeAlpha_BasicNetworkSniffer

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a basic network sniffer built using Python and the Scapy library.  
It captures live network packets and displays important information such as source IP, destination IP, and protocol type.

## 🎯 Objective
To understand how network traffic flows and analyze packet-level data using Python.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Scapy Library

## 🚀 Features
- Captures live network traffic
- Displays Source IP Address
- Displays Destination IP Address
- Identifies Protocol (TCP/UDP/Other)
- Counts captured packets

## 📂 How to Run

1. Install Python
2. Install Scapy:
   python -m pip install scapy

3. Run the script:
   python network_sniffer.py

4. Press CTRL + C to stop the program

## 📸 Output Example
The program continuously displays captured packet details in real time.

## 📖 What I Learned
- Basics of packet sniffing
- Understanding IP layer structure
- Identifying network protocols
- Real-time traffic monitoring
